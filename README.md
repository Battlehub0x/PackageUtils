##Installation

The easiest way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/net.battlehub.packageutils?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=net.battlehub)

It runs a script that installs Package Utils via a scoped registry.

Afterwards Package Utils is listed in the Package Manager (under My Registries) and can be installed and updated from there.
